clickin.space is a project collaboration between Matthew Ardizzone, Adam Cogdell, Kenan Poole, and Michael York for [HackNC](http://hacknc.com/) 2019. Our idea was to create a clicker-style game to go with the theme of HackNC 2019, "Hello World":

> The sun has fizzled away and the Earth is left fending for itself with no light. You have been tasked with powering the rocket that is tethered to the Earth, pulling it towards the nearest habitable star in the Andromeda galaxy. In this game, you can click on the rocket to spend fuel to move the Earth, or click the Earth to generate fuel. Along the way, you can hire miners, extractors, and more, to make your fuel production faster, and eventually get the Earth to it's new home.

## HackNC
HackNC is an annual, student-run hackathon hosted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where students are given 24 hours (with no prewritten code) to work on a project in an attempt to learn more and build something cool. Learn more here: [HackNC](http://hacknc.com).

## Technologies Used
Our frontend and game logic were written completely by hand, with no game libraries. Our music and game art were produced by a couple of our group members. Our backend is an ExpressJS server connecting to a mongoDB Atlas instance, running on Google Cloud. Our website was accesible at [clickin.space](http://clickin.space).
